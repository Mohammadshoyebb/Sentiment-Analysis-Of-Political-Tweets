# Sentiment Analysis of Political Tweets

This project analyzes the sentiment of tweets related to political figures (Modi and Rahul) using Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, TextBlob for sentiment analysis, and Plotly for visualization.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on tweets collected from two political figures: Modi and Rahul. The sentiment analysis categorizes tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their polarity scores computed using TextBlob's sentiment analysis capabilities. The results are visualized using Plotly to compare the sentiment distribution between the two politicians.
